$1 normally uses encryption to protect your information. When Cromite tried to connect to $1 this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. This may happen when an attacker is trying to pretend to be $1, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Cromite stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.
