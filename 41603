This problem happens because of a certificate you or someone else installed on your device. The certificate is known to be used to monitor and intercept networks, and is not trusted by Iridium. While some legitimate cases for monitoring do exist, like on a school or company network, Iridium wants to make sure you're aware it's happening, even if you can't stop it. Monitoring may happen in any browser or application that accesses the web.
